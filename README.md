# Sculpt

Sculpt is a tool for displaying and printing information about Jira issues with Slack and AWS SQS integration

## Getting Started

Sculpt is a work in progress so for now you'll need an IDE that supports .NET Core 2.1 to run it.
As long as I haven't messed anything up, running SculPt should be as simple as opening it in Visual Studio and hitting F5.
Out of the box, Sculpt won't be configured so open up the appsettings.json file and fill in all the settings listed.
Once that's done, Sculpt is ready to go.



### Prerequisites

For full-feature access you will need;
* An AWS SQS and the corresponding Access Key and Secret Access Key
* A Slack Webhook URL
* A Jira account and Authentication Key
